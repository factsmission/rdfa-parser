    <h2>Note</h2>
    At the time of publishing this wasn't working because of an outdated version of rdf-ext at <em>http://rdf-ext.bergnet.org/dist/rdf-ext-all-latest.js</em>. As soon as that resource is updated, it should work again.

    I think White's book
    '<span about="urn:ISBN:0091808189" typeof="bibo:Book" property="dc:title">Canteen Cuisine</span>'
    is well worth getting since although it's quite advanced stuff, he
    makes it pretty easy to follow. You might also like
